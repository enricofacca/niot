This directory contains the data and the scripts used in the manuscript:
"Network Inpainting via Optimal Transport".

First, follow the instructions described in the README file in the home directory.
The Firedrake version used during the experiments can be installed using

```
firedrake-install --doi
```

The ./data/ directory contains the inputs images.
Reproduce all experiments with
```
python run_parallel.py
```

This script runs in parallel all experiments shown in the paper, one processor for experiment. Consider that it may require a lot of memory. Use
```
python run_parallel.py --help
```
to see the available options.


The directory ./results/ will contain the reconstructed images, stored in pvd/vtu format.

The script plot_figures.py will generate the images shown in the manuscripts.
The directory tex_figures/ contains a series of tex files to obtain the figures shown in the papers.

The directory ./classical_inpaiting/ contains two MATLAB scripts based on the thi code and adapted to the experiments in the paper.
