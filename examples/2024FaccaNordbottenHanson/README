This directory contains the data and the scripts used in the manuscript:
"Network Inpainting via Optimal Transport" 

The command to reproduce all experiments is
```
python run_parallel.py
```
It runs in parallel all experiments shown in the paper. One processor for experiment (consider that it may require a lot of memory).

The directories 
./y_net/ 
./y_nret_nref2/
./frog_tounge/

contains the inputs images and the results of the reconstructed images, stored in pvd/vtu format.

The directory ./plot_tools/ contains a series of scripts genereating the images shown in the manuscripts.

The directory ./classical_inpaiting/ contains two MATLAB scripts based on the thi code and adapted to the experiments in the paper.
